## Security
wiki.gg takes the security of our services, servers and user data very seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in/on any wiki.gg site, server, service, MediaWiki extension or any other code that we maintain, please report it to us after having read the following instructions carefully.

## Reporting security issues
**Do not discuss any vulnerabilities through publicly visible channels, such as (but not limited to) public GitHub issues, discussions, merge requests, our Discord server, IRC channels, Support Wiki, or any other wiki.**

Instead, please notify our team through one of the following two channels:

  * Send an email to **security**[@]**wiki.gg**;
  * or create a ticket in [our servicedesk](https://wiki.gg/t/secissue).

We ask that you include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us triage your report quicker and better understand the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g. cross-site scripting, arbitrary code execution, privilege check bypass, data exposure)
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue (or a link to a wiki.gg-hosted wiki you found the issue on)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker could exploit the issue
  * The location of the affected source code
  * Any other details that you find relevant
